## Notes

- Add Redux to hold global variables (e.g. birthdate for about page to calculate age)
- Focus on content first, can always redesign later
- Design inspiration (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/la11Z4FvPk0/maxresdefault.jpg)
- Make more recent TODOs at the top, and older ones at the bottom
- Export default in class declaration (e.g. Experience.tsx)

experience object: place, start date, end date (calculate time from this), position, order by datetime
